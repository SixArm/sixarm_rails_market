!! Layouts

We use a layout customizer to provide layouts that depend on the request host.

For example, a request to <code>http://example.com</code> has the request host <code>example.com</code> and there is a folder <code>app/views/layouts/example.com/</code>

The <code>app/views/layouts/</code> folder has a subdirectory for each domain
that we are hosting. 

Each host get its own layout folder:
  * Request host: <code>example.com</code>
  * Within the Rails app: <code>app/views/layouts/example.com/</code>
  * Application layout: app/views/layouts/example.com/application.html.erb</code>

We build this feature in ApplicationController:

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base

    layout :layout_customizer

    private
    def layout_customizer
      layout_folder + "application"
    end

    def layout_folder
      # We trim a leading "a." because we use this
      # convention for localhost development.
      request.host().sub(/^a\./,'') + "/"
    end

end
